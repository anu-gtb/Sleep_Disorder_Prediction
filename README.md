# Sleep_Disorder_Prediction

# Problem Statement

Sleep disorders have an increasing impact on mental and physical health and are a developing global concern. Their multiple causes include environmental variables, stress, food, and lifestyle choices. Early detection of these variables can enhance sleep hygiene and lower health risks, but conventional diagnostic techniques are expensive and difficult to use. By analyzing trends and providing early detection of sleep disorders, a predictive model built on routine data could facilitate diagnosis and enable preventative intervention. This kind of model would provide a more workable and affordable approach to enhancing sleep and general well-being, which would tackle the difficulty of comprehending the complex causes of sleep problems.

# Proposed Solution

Data-driven Predictions -: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze datasets that include lifestyle metrics (such as activity levels, diet, screen time, and stress) and sleep data (like sleep duration, cycles, and disturbances).

# Work-flow

# Future Scope

1. Health Integration

   Future systems could integrate sleep predictions with other health data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) to provide holistic health assessments, detecting correlations between sleep disorders and other 
   diseases like cardiovascular disorders or diabetes.


2. Integration of the Data in Wearable Devices - Integrating data and other health-related information from wearable devices (fitness trackers, smartwatches, etc.) to improve prediction accuracy and offer ongoing, real-time insights into a person's health metrics and sleep patterns.

3. Predict Insights in Real Time â€“ It provides real-time insights using wearable devices like smartwatches and your lifestyle data.
